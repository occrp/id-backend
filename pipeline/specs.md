# Editorial Pipeline

The goal is to have complete insight into the process of developing stories within OCCRP, from basic research through to initial writing, to editing, copy editing, and publication.

The intended product is a Django application that can exist standalone or plug in to our existing Investigative Dashboard (ID) project (thereby exposing more features). It should base off ID's user model and other infrastructure.
